# CODE QUIZ APPLICATION

## Description 

The Coding Quiz Challenge is a web-based application that I developed to offer users a timed quiz on JavaScript, HTML and CSS fundamentals while also enabling the storage of high scores. This project was a significant step in applying the knowledge gained in a coding boot camp to a real-world scenario. This project features a dynamic and responsive user interface powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It follows the structure and principles of a typical coding assessment, offering a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. The quiz is timed, and incorrect answers lead to time deductions, simulating the conditions of a real coding challenge. Each correct answers will add 15 seconds to the candidate's time and time remaining will be the end score. The challenge was multifaceted, requiring the implementation of features such as a timer, multiple-choice questions, score calculation, and local storage usage. This hands-on experience led to a deeper understanding of event listeners, HTML element manipulation, and the overall flow of functions in a web application. It was an opportunity to overcome obstacles and gain practical insights into front-end web development.
